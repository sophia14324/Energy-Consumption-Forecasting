DATA FRAMEWORK

D – Define the Problem
Clearly state the business or research question you aimed to solve.
Example: “We wanted to predict customer churn to proactively retain high-value customers.”

A – Approach / Methodology
Outline the steps, models, and tools used—briefly but logically.
Example: “We used CRISP-DM methodology, gathering customer usage data, cleaning it, and then applying a gradient boosting model to predict churn probability.”

T – Tools / Techniques
Highlight specific technologies and frameworks (e.g., Python, R, TensorFlow), emphasizing why they were suitable.
Example: “We chose XGBoost for speed and interpretability. Our pipeline was built in Python using scikit-learn for preprocessing.”

A – Achievements / Results
Share outcome metrics, lessons learned, and the broader impact of the project.
Example: “We achieved a 93% AUC, and by targeting the predicted churners with personalized promotions, we retained 40% of them. This led to an estimated $200k monthly revenue increase.”
